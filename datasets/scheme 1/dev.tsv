What is the name of the disease caused buy SARS-COV-2?	People returning from affected areas are likely to have a low threshold to seek care and be tested when symptomatic, however delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany meant that locally acquired cases took longer to be detected and isolated.	0

Why is it statistically impossible to determine which individual intervention had the greatest effect on reducing the coronavirus reproduction number?	Lockdown has a very large effect, most likely due to the fact that it occurs after other interventions in our dataset.	0
What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?	In contrast, age-speciﬁc death rates in the 1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been documented before or since: a “W—shaped” curve, similar to the familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third (middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410 years of age.	1
What may studies in natural exacerbations and in viral-challenge models using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) or single cell RNA-seq on a range of time-points  provide?
