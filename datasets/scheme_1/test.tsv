What does infection of respiratory viruses cause?	These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 .	0
What have these studies also shown?	Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection.	0

Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?	Data consis- tent with this possibility were reported at the time from European military camps (23), but a counter argument is that if a strain with a new hemagglutinin (HA) was caus- ing enough illness to affect the US national death rates from pneumonia and inﬂuenza, it should have caused a pandemic sooner, and when it eventually did, in 1918, many people should have been immune or at least partial- ly immunoprotected.	0

What is Germany's estimated mean percentage [95% credible interval] of total population infected as of 28th March?	Country % of total population infected (mean [95% credible intervall) Austria 1.1% [0.36%-3.1%] Belgium 3.7% [1.3%-9.7%] Denmark 1.1% [0.40%-3.1%] France 3.0% [1.1%-7.4%] Germany 0.72% [0.28%-1.8%] Italy 9.8% [3.2%-26%] Norway 0.41% [0.09%-1.2%] Spain 15% [3.7%-41%] Sweden 3.1% [0.85%-8.4%] Switzerland 3.2% [1.3%-7.6%] United Kingdom 2.7% [1.2%-5.4%]  2.2 Reproduction numbers and impact of interventions  Averaged across all countries, we estimate initial reproduction numbers of around 3.87 [3.01-4.66], which is in line with other estimates.1'8 These estimates are informed by our choice of serial interval distribution and the initial growth rate of observed deaths.	1
What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause?	Moreover, the destruction of the epithelial barrier may cause further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations.	1
What was the result of China's interventions introduced in January?	For Italy, where far more time has passed since the interventions have been implemented, it is clear that the model without interventions does not fit well to the data, and cannot explain the sub-linear (on the logarithmic scale) reduction in deaths (see Figure 10).	0
What symptoms might people experience with COVID19?	31 Recall that in 2001, the anthrax letter attacks were initially thought to be naturally occurring.	0
What is the key aim of non-pharmaceutical interventions?	178, 1505—1512 (20131  15.	0
What are also associated with viral infections and pneumonia development, which may worsen inflammation in the lower airway?	This also increases the chances of allergens coming into contact with airway immune cells.	0
What is an example of this?	Text: The prevalence of chronic airway inflammatory disease is increasing worldwide especially in developed nations (GBD 2015 Chronic Respiratory Disease Collaborators, 2017 Guan et al., 2018) .	0
What is the estimated infection-to-death distribution's mean for coronavirus?	Bundesministerium.	0
Why viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation?	Further research can be done similarly for the airway microbiome to be able to restore the microbiome following disruption by a viral infection.	0
What was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	At the same time, the 1918 sequences have too few amino acid diﬁerences from those of wild-bird strains to have spent many years adapting only in a human or swine intermedi- ate host.	0
How many cases were asymptomatic?	In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection.	0
Who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ?	This is further complicated by the effect of episodic exacerbations of the disease, defined as worsening of disease symptoms including wheeze, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness (Xepapadaki and Papadopoulos, 2010) .	0
What is an infection-to-onset-distribution?	The modelled deaths are informed by an infection-to-onset distribution (time from infection to the onset of symptoms), an onset-to-death distribution (time from the onset of symptoms to death), and the population-averaged infection fatality ratio (adjusted for the age structure and contact patterns of each country, see Appendix).	1
What are the descriptive statistics for the onset-to-death for coronavirus?	This work was supported by Centre funding from the UK Medical Research Council under a concordat with the UK Department for International Development, the NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology and CommunityJameel.	0
Example of social distancing	Our definition is restricted to nationwide government advice to all individuals (e.g.	0
What is included in RBPs?	I also discuss alternative posttranslational and RNA-based antiviral approaches, designer vaccines, immunotherapy and the emerging field of neo-virology.	0
In 2009 what was the reported H1N1 vaccination rate in China?	The immunization rates of the seasonal flu and H1N1vaccine were 7.5% and 10.8%, respectively.	1
What is estimated to drop immediately after an introduction of a non-pharmaceutical intervention?	The proportion of the population infected  to date — the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany and Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics.	0
What diagnostic test is correlated with the severity of HFRS?	The antiviral mechanism of IFITM3 is thought to be the restriction of viral entry into cells (4, 12) .	0
What is an onset-to-death distribution?	Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.	0
Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?	3.	0
Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?	However, patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease.	1
What are the descriptive statistics for the incubation period for coronavirus?	Radosevich.	0
