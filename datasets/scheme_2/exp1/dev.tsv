What other data on pre-existing conditions were reported?	Data on pre-existing conditions were reported for seven cases; five had no pre-existing conditions while one was reported to be obese and one had pre-existing cardiac disease.	1
For what  purpose animal based models aare developed for?	Furthermore, the humanized mouse model that possess human immune cells may also serves to unravel the immune profile of a viral infection in healthy and diseased condition (Ito et al., 2019; Li and Di Santo, 2019) .	1
What are  miRNAs found to be induced by?	miRNAs are found to be induced by viral infections and may play a role in the modulation of antiviral responses and inflammation (Gutierrez et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2018) .	1
What was the clinical evolution of the hospitalised cases?	All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four, two reported in Italy and two reported in France, all of whom developed viral pneumonia.	1

Why were they hospitalised?	Cases from the Bavarian cluster were reported from Germany and Spain, whereas cases from the Haute-Savoie cluster were reported from France All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported), although it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease.	1
What is a way to measure virus transmission?	In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national Iockdowns.	0
What growing dysjunction has been witnessed?	Plumbing work on research funding and development pipelines through recent changes in the structure of government funding, 2 new public and private joint ventures and specialist undergraduate and postgraduate courses now aim to incorporate pathways to translation at the earliest stages.	0
What is required for locally acquired cases?	Locally acquired cases require significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population.	1

What does the viral infection alter?	Moreover, a viral infection may also alter the nutrient profile in the airway through release of previously inaccessible nutrients that will alter bacterial growth (Siegel et al., 2014; Mallia et al., 2018) .	1
What was the estimated effect on China's reproduction number in March based on the intervention introduced in January?	Studies have estimated how Rt changed during this time in different areas ofChina from around 2-4 during the uncontrolled epidemic down to below 1, with an estimated 7-9 fold decrease in the number of daily contacts per person.1'2 Control measures such as social distancing, intensive testing, and contact tracing in other countries such as Singapore and South Korea have successfully reduced case incidence in recent weeks, although there is a riskthe virus will spread again once control measures are relaxed.3'4  The epidemic began slightly laterin Europe, from January or later in different regions.5 Countries have implemented different combinations of control measures and the level of adherence to government recommendations on social distancing is likely to vary between countries, in part due to different levels of enforcement.	1
Why is there high uncertainty in estimating the impact of interventions against the coronavirus?	It is too early to detect substantial intervention impact in many countries at earlier stages of their epidemic (e.g.	1

What was the estimated effect on China's reproduction number in March based on the intervention introduced in January?	In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, widescale social distancing including local and national Iockdowns.	0
What is a lockdown?	As an overall definition, we consider regulations/legislations regarding strict face-to-face social interaction: including the banning of any non-essential public gatherings, closure of educational and  public/cultural institutions, ordering people to stay home apart from exercise and essential tasks.	1

Furthermore, the inflammatory environment may also disperse upper airway commensals into the lower airway, further causing inflammation and alteration of the lower airway environment, resulting in prolong exacerbation episodes following viral infection.	1
